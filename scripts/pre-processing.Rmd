# Load data:
```{r}
expression_data <- fread("../../OmicsExpressionProteinCodingGenesTPMLogp1.csv")
meta_data <- fread("../../Model.csv", na.strings = c("", "unknown", "Unknown", "None")) 
# Both Unknown and unknown because they were both used in various columns and None was used for 
# Platecoating which was all equal to none, so row can be removed
```

# Change colname in expression data
```{r}
# Makes merging easier
colnames(expression_data)[1] <- "ModelID"
```

# Make expression data tidy:
```{r}
# Make the data tidy
tidy_data <- expression_data %>% 
            pivot_longer(
                cols = 2:ncol(expression_data),
                names_to = "gene",
                values_to = "expression")

```

# Save the two seperate data files:
```{r}
write_feather(x = tidy_data, path = "expression_data.tsv")
write_feather(x = meta_data, path = "meta_data.tsv")
