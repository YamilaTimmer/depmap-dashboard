## Description

The [Dependency Map](https://depmap.org/portal/) (DepMap) portal offers large batches of open-access cancer research data, in order to support new scientific discoveries within the field. The goal is to map the 'landscape' of cancer vulnerabilities, through different approaches:

- Capturing genetic and molecular diversity of human cancer, by gathering more than 2000 different models
- Identifying genes that are required for cell growth and drug sensitivities
- Creating a map of cancer vulnerabilities
- Identifying genetic and molecular alterations in cancer cells

If you would like to learn more about these running DepMap projects, it is highly recommend you visit [their website](https://depmap.org/portal/home/#/our-approach). This data dashboard focuses mainly on the first and last pointer. It is able to compare metadata, cell lines, genes, and gene expression. While visualising large amounts of data has proven to be difficult, the DepMap Data Dashboard is a tool that allows users to visualise DepMap data in various ways, including bar plots, boxplots, violin plots, and heatmaps. Users can do all of this while filtering on specific metadata to include/exclude the data, as the user wishes. 

### Key-features
- Visualise large batches of DepMap data,
- Allows selecting different metadata parameters, to fine-tune data,
- Generating plots with the data, including bar plots, boxplots, violin plots and heatmaps,
- Generating sortable tables with the filtered data,
- The ability to save the generated visuals (.png) and the table data (.csv/.xlsx),
- User-friendly dashboard interface.

## System requirements and installation

### System requirements

- OS: Linux
- R: 4.0 or higher

## Future plans

This dashboard will be converted into an R package, which allows for easier installing and usage. Possibly it will also be hosted on a local server.

### Installing tools
Download the following DepMap datasets from [https://depmap.org/portal/data_page/?tab=allData](https://depmap.org/portal/data_page/?tab=allData):

- `OmicsExpressionProteinCodingGenesTPMLogp1`
- `Model.csv`

Navigate to the top of the page and enter the two dataset names in the search bar.



**Clone the repository**

```bash

git clone git@github.com:YamilaTimmer/depmap-dashboard.git

```

**Install the required R packages**

```r
install.packages(c(
  "ggplot2",
  "shiny", 
  "bslib", 
  "shinyjs", 
  "bsicons", 
  "shinyjqui", 
  "plotly", 
  "feather", 
  "DT",
  "shinycssloaders"
))
```

### Version details
The application is made using R version [4.4.0](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) (Puppy Cup) and the following R packages are integrated into the data dashboard:

| Package Name        | Description                                                 | Version   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) | Package that allows creating interactive R applications |1.9.1|
| [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)| Used for making all plots (bar plot, boxplot, violin plot, heatmap)|3.5.1|
| [bslib](https://github.com/rstudio/bslib/) | Used for layout/structuring of application  |0.8.0|
| [shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs) | Improves user experience, using JavaScript|2.1.0|
| [bsicons](https://github.com/rstudio/bsicons)| Used to add icons to application |0.1.2|

| [DT](https://github.com/rstudio/DT)| Used for interactive data table output in application |0.33|

### Pre-processing

Before the datasets can be used in the application, a little pre-processing will have to take place. This can be done by running the code in the following R-markdown file: [scripts/pre-processing.Rmd](https://github.com/YamilaTimmer/depmap-portal-data-visualizations/blob/main/scripts/pre-processing_data.R). (note: this step can take up to a few minutes, this is caused by the size of the dataset. This step will only have to be performed **once**):


### Launch the app

Now that the R data objects are created, the app itself can be run as follows:

```r
library(shiny)
runApp('app')
```

## Usage
### Select Parameters
Use the sidebar to select the wanted genes, cancer types, and additional demographic filters, including patient sex, race, and age category.

- **Genes**: include a total of 19194 humane genes
- **Cancer types** (OncotreePrimaryDisease): contains a plethora of different cancer diseases of which the cell lines were extracted 
- **Sex**: biological sex the patient was born with, contains 3 options, 'Female', 'Male' and 'unknown' (due to some missing values). 'Male' and 'Female' are selected by default.
- **Race**: patient race, contains the following options: 'caucasian', 'asian', 'black_or_african_american', 'african', 'american_indian_or_native_american', 'east_indian', 'north_african' and unknown (due to some missing values)
- **Age category**: age category of patient, contains 4 options: 'Fetus', 'Pediatric', 'Adult' and unknown (due to some missing values)


After selecting the parameters, the sidebar can be collapsed to allow more space for the visualisation and data table.


## Generate Visualizations

1. Select type of plot to generate in the tabs menu (options: barplot, boxplot/violin plot and heatmap)
2. View the visualization in full screen by pressing the 'expand' button in the bottom right of the tab
3. Further options can be selected, in the sidebar on the left, options differ per plot type
4. The visualization can be resized by hovering over the edges of the plot and dragging the mouse
5. The visualization can be saved by pressing the 'save as .png' button


## Explore data
View the data that is generated for the selected parameters, in the table on the right side. The data table can be viewed in full screen by pressing the 'expand' button in the bottom right of the tab. What columns will be displayed can be chosen in the column selector at the top. The data can be sorted on columns from low/high, or you can perform do a specific search using the search bar in the top right. Additional metadata can be viewed in the table, by choosing additional columns in the column selector. A short description for all columns can be found in the [appendix](README.md#appendix). Keep in mind, some columns have a lot of missing values (NA values). 

The data can be sorted by clicking the arrows next to the column names (from high-low or low-high) and by clicking the gene names a new window will open with a link to [https://www.genecards.org/](https://www.genecards.org/) with the page corresponding to the selected gene, for more information about the gene. 

### Saving the data
Using the download buttons, the data can be saved as either a comma-seperated-value (.csv) file, or an excel file (.xslx)

# How to interpret the data
## Background info

This application shows gene expression over cell lines and can be used to interpret certain relations between gene expression and different cancer types. The application also allows filtering on age category, sex and ethnic background, so relations might also be found. Please see the [appendix](README.md#appendix) or the application for all possible options within these filters.

A gene is a piece of DNA that codes for a protein. **Gene expression** means how much a gene is transcripted to RNA and then translated to a protein. The more this occurs, the higher a gene is expressed. Cancer can be linked to gene expression. For example, certain genes that prevent cancer (tumor-suppressor genes) might not be expressed as much in patients with cancer. It also works the other way around, genes that can cause cancer (oncogenes) are often seen in higher expression levels in patients with cancer. The expression of the genes can be found in `OmicsExpressionProteinCodingGenesTPMLogp1.csv`.

The **cell lines** refer to populations of cells that are derived from patients with different types of cancer. Which allows for 'in vitro' research, which is done outside of the patient, which has the benefit that it can be studied without potentially harming the patient. Information about the cell lines can be found in `Model.csv`.
